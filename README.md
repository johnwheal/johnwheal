### Hi there 👋 I'm John Wheal

I'm a Chartered Engineer 🚀 with the IET and have a Masters in Computer Engineering 🖥️ from the University of Portsmouth.  

I work for UK air traffic control as a solution architect and specialise in large-scale safety critical distributed systems.

My day job doesn't involve programming but you'll often find me on here in my spare time.
